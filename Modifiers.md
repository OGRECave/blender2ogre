# Blender Modifiers
Modifiers are automatic operations that affect an objectâ€™s geometry in a non-destructive way. 
With modifiers, you can perform many effects automatically that would otherwise be too tedious to do manually 
(such as subdivision surfaces) and without affecting the base geometry of your object.

`blender2ogre` supports exporting meshes with modifiers, but not all modifiers are supported.
Also, some modifiers have special treatment (Array and Armature), please check the corresponding sections

> NOTE: Support for modifiers is *best effort*, in most cases the modifiers have been tested individually and not all combinations have been tried.

> **WARNING**: Beware of using Modifiers that increase the vertex o poly count of the models when exporting (like Subdivision Surface) since the exported mesh might not be very optimal for realtime rendering. Retopology is advised in these cases to improve render times.

## Array Modifier
This modifier as well as the `Armature Modifier` get their special section because they are treated differently by `blender2ogre`.
Most modifiers are applied before exporting the model (without affecting the object) by converting an evaluated copy of the object into a mesh.

However the case of the `Array Modifier` is different, since the presence of this modifier has `blender2ogre` treat the object differently.

What happens is that in `scene.py` (which creates the .scene output) the `Array Modifier` is used to place instances of the mesh in positions indicated by the modifier.
This means that the exported mesh appearance is not modified by the `Array Modifier`, but only its placement in the scene.

As a result, there is only one copy of the mesh in the scene that is repeated many times, which could lead to a performance increase if using instancing.

> NOTE: To disable this behavior and have the `Array Modifier` be applied to the mesh directly, then set the option: `ARRAY` to true in the mesh options

## Boolean Modifier
This modifier works well and is in principle fully supported, but you might get this error when exporting meshes with the `Boolean Modifier`:
```
FAILED to assign material to face - you might be using a Boolean Modifier between objects with different materials! [ mesh : Cube ]
```

The issue here is that `blender2ogre` has a problem when the two objects that make contact to perform the boolean operation don't have the same material assigned to the faces which enter into contact.

To solve this you need to assign the same material to the faces which are in contact, this might be as simple as assigning a Material to the whole secondary object or having to do something more complex like assigning the same material to the faces that come into contact by entering `Edit Mode` and assigning the material by hand to each face.

As a last resort, it is also possible to make a copy by hand of the object by applying the `Boolean Modifier` and exporting that mesh.
