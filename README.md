## Installing
Copy the [io_ogre](io_ogre) folder into the [$BLENDER_DIR](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/blender_directory_layout.html)`/scripts/addons` folder.
Note on Windows: you have to set the correct path to `OGRETOOLS_XML_CONVERTER` in [io_ogre/config.py](io_ogre/config.py) prior to the first run.  
After installing the addon enable it in Blender from `User Preferences > Add-Ons > Import-Export` (CTRL+ALT+U). Search for `ogre` and check the box on the right. Remember to save as default if you want the addon to be enabled after you exit your Blender.  
Integrated help docs will be shown in the upper right hand toolbar, replacing blender's normal `Help` menu, read them for assistance.

The following versions of blender have been tested. It might also work with older versions of Blender.

* Blender 2.7x
* Blender 2.6x
* **Blender 2.8x: use master branch**

For OGRE v2.1 meshes, use OgreMeshTool from Ogre 2 build for `OGRETOOLS_XML_CONVERTER`

## Updating to new versions ##
If you are upgrading from a previous version of blender2ogre, and having problems, you may want to delete your old .pickle config file from
[$BLENDER_DIR](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/blender_directory_layout.html)`/config/scripts/blender2ogre.pickle` and restart blender.

## Additional Features

### Merge Objects on export
You might have hundrets of objects, which you want to keep separate but have them in one `.mesh` on export.
For this create a new group (Ctrl+G) named as `merge.<yourname>`. The output will be a single `<yourname>.mesh` file. Alternatively link the group.

### External OGRE Materials
You might already have some materials in OGRE that you do not want to export.
Prefix them with `extern.<yourname>` and the sub entity will have the material name set,
but the material is not exported. The following material 'vertexcolor' can be defined in
your OGRE project:

![extern-material.png](images/extern-material.png)

### Console Export
You might have several blender files in your project you want to export to Ogre. Do this by hand? NO! You can do better! After all, you have build scripts to compile your source code? Why not export your files automated?
Here is how you can export a scene with blender2ogre. Take a look at [io_ogre/console.py](io_ogre/console.py). You might want to write your own script for your project to export individual objects.

```bash
$ cd blender2ogre
$ blender -b examples/vertex-colored.blend --python io_ogre/console.py -- /tmp/blender 'scene abc'
Processing Scene - abc

      - Exporting root node: Camera
  Exported Ogre Scene: /tmp/blender/abc.scene

Blender quit
$ ls /tmp/blender
abc.scene  Cube.mesh  Cube.mesh.xml  Material.material
```

### Exporting Custom Vertex Groups
As shown in the picture below, you can now export SubEntities that contain
a user defined amount of faces.

![blender-vertex-group.png](images/blender-vertex-group.png)

You simply call your vertex group with the
prefix `ogre.vertex.group.<yourname>` and access it in Ogre similar to
the following:

```cpp
void example(const Ogre::Entity * entity)
{
    auto collision = entity->getSubEntity("collision");
    auto mesh = collision->getSubMesh();
    VertexData * data = nullptr;
    if (!mesh->useSharedVertices) {
        data = mesh->vertexData;
    } else {
        data = mesh->parent->sharedVertexData;
    }
    auto pos_cursor = data->vertexDeclaration->findElementBySemantic(Ogre::VES_POSITION);
    auto vbuffer = data->vertexBufferBinding->getBuffer(pos_cursor->getSource());
    auto ibuffer = mesh->indexData->indexBuffer;

    uint16_t * indices = static_cast<uint16_t*>(ibuffer->lock(Ogre::HardwareBuffer::HBL_READ_ONLY));
    float * vertices = static_cast<float*>(vbuffer->lock(Ogre::HardwareBuffer::HBL_READ_ONLY));
    float * v;
    int count = mesh->indexData->indexCount;
    int stride = vbuffer->getVertexSize() / 4;
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i+=3) {
        uint16_t a = indices[i], b = indices[i+1], c = indices[i+2];
        pos_cursor->baseVertexPointerToElement(vertices + a * stride, &v);
        Vector3 va(v);
        pos_cursor->baseVertexPointerToElement(vertices + b * stride, &v);
        Vector3 vb(v);
        pos_cursor->baseVertexPointerToElement(vertices + c * stride, &v);
        Vector3 vc(v);
        // do something with your triangle here
    }
    ibuffer->unlock();
    vbuffer->unlock();
}
```
The vertex group will get the material name 'none' so you might want to add the following script:

```
material none {
    technique {
        pass {
           // ...
        }
    }
}
```

### Exporting Skeletal Animations
![skeletal-animations.png](images/skeletal-animations.png)

Skeletal Animation refers to the technique of using bones to deform a mesh as if the mesh were the skin.
This kind of animation is commonly used to animate characters in videogames.
Check out the [Skeletal Animations README](SkeletalAnimation.md) to see how to create and export an animated mesh.

### Exporting Particle Systems
![particle-system5.png](images/particle-system5.png)

A common technique for laying out random objects on a scene in Blender is to use the Particle System. 
Check out the [Particle System README](ParticleSystem.md) to see how to create and export a scene where the trees, foliage and rocks are distributed randomly using a particle system.

### Exporting Shape Animations
![shape-animations4.png](images/shape-animations4.png)

Shape (or Pose) Animations allow animating different poses, a technique commonly used to do face animations.
Check out the [Shape Animations](ShapeAnimations.md) tutorial to see how to create some poses and animate them. Then you can use `blender2ogre` to export the poses and animations into a `.mesh` file.

### Exporting Node Animations
Node Animations are a way to have scripted node animations in your Ogre application.
Check out the [Node Animations](NodeAnimations.md) tutorial to see how to create some animations for a couple of different scenarios.

## About
[The original version of this](https://bitbucket.org/iboshkov/blender2ogre) was a *single* monolithic Python file.
This is not maintainable, and contains a tremendous amount of bugs. There was the need to export blender model to ogre from
the console, thus I rewrote the whole script and split it into several files.
It has been well tested on linux 64-bit and should work with others.

## Authors
This Blender addon was made possible by the following list of people. Anyone can contribute to the project by sending bug reports and feature requests [here](https://github.com/OGRECave/blender2ogre/issues). Naturally the most welcome contribution is actual code via [pull requests](https://github.com/OGRECave/blender2ogre/pulls). If you are planning to implement something "big", it's a good practise to discuss it in the issue tracker first with other authors. So that there is no overlap with other developers or the overall roadmap.
